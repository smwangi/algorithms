/**
 * Maximize array sum after K negations | Set 2
 *
 * Given an array of size n and a number k. We must modify array K number of times.
 * Here modify array means in each operation we can replace any array element arr[i] by -arr[i].
 * We need to perform this operation in such a way that after K operations, sum of array must be maximum?
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : arr[] = {-2, 0, 5, -1, 2}
 *         K = 4
 * Output: 10
 * // Replace (-2) by -(-2), array becomes {2, 0, 5, -1, 2}
 * // Replace (-1) by -(-1), array becomes {2, 0, 5, 1, 2}
 * // Replace (0) by -(0), array becomes {2, 0, 5, 1, 2}
 * // Replace (0) by -(0), array becomes {2, 0, 5, 1, 2}
 *
 * Input : arr[] = {9, 8, 8, 5}
 *         K = 3
 * Output: 20

     * The idea used in above post is to replace the minimum element arr[i] in array by -arr[i] for current operation.
     * In this way we can make sum of array maximum after K operations. Once interesting case is,
     * once minimum element becomes 0, we donâ€™t need to make any more changes.
     *
     * The implementation used in above solution uses linear search to find minimum element.
     * The time complexity of the above discussed solution is O(nk)
     *
     * In this post an optimized solution is implemented that uses a priority queue (or binary heap) to find minimum element quickly.
