/**
 * Kth smallest element in the array using constant space when array can’t be modified
 *
 * Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K, the task is to find the Kth smallest element from the array in
 * constant extra space and the array can’t be modified.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3
 * Output: 7
 * Given array in sorted is {3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20}
 * where 7 is the third smallest element.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {12, 3, 5, 7, 19}, K = 2
 * Output: 5
 *
 * Approach: First we find the min and max element from the array. Then we set low = min, high = max and mid = (low + high) / 2.
 * Now, perform a modified binary search, and for each mid we count the number of elements less than mid and equal to mid.
 * If countLess < k and countLess + countEqual ≥ k then mid is our answer, else we have to modify our low and high.
