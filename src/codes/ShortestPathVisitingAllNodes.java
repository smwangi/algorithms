 * An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) is given as graph.

 * graph.length = N, and j != i is in the list graph[i] exactly once, if and only if nodes i and j are connected.
 *
 * Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]

     * Breadth First Search
     * Intuition
     *
     * A path 'state' can be represented as the subset of nodes visited, plus the current 'head' node.
     * Then, the problem reduces to a shortest path problem among these states, which can be solved with a breadth-first search.
     *
     * Algorithm
     * Let's call the set of nodes visited by a path so far the cover, and the current node as the head.
     * We'll store the cover states using set bits: k is in the cover if the kth bit of cover is 1.
     *
     * For states state = (cover, head), we can perform a breadth-first search on these states.
     * The neighbors are (cover | (1 << child), child) for each child in graph[head].
     *
     * If at any point we find a state with all set bits in it's cover, because it is a breadth-first search,
     * we know this must represent the shortest path length.

    /**
     * Intuition
     *
     * A path 'state' can be represented as the subset of nodes visited, plus the current 'head' node. As in Approach #1, we have a recurrence in states: answer(cover, head) is min(1 + answer(cover | (1<<child), child) for child in graph[head]). Because these states form a DAG (a directed graph with no cycles), we can do dynamic programming.
     *
     * Algorithm
     *
     * Let's call the set of nodes visited by a path so far the cover, and the current node as the head. We'll store dist[cover][head] as the length of the shortest path with that cover and head. We'll store the cover states using set bits, and maintain the loop invariant (on cover), that dist[k][...] is correct for k < cover.
     *
     * For every state (cover, head), the possible next (neighbor) nodes in the path are found in graph[head]. The new cover2 is the old cover plus next.
     *
     * For each of these, we perform a "relaxation step" (for those familiar with the Bellman-Ford algorithm), where if the new candidate distance for dist[cover2][next] is larger than dist[cover][head] + 1, we'll update it to dist[cover][head] + 1.
     *
     * Care must be taken to perform the relaxation step multiple times on the same cover if cover = cover2. This is because a minimum state for dist[cover][head] might only be achieved through multiple steps through some path.
     *
     * Finally, it should be noted that we are using implicitly the fact that when iterating cover = 0 .. (1<<N) - 1, that each new cover cover2 = cover | 1 << x is such that cover2 >= cover. This implies a topological ordering, which means that the recurrence on these states form a DAG.
