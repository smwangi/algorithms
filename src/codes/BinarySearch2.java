/**
 * Through our app, a customer can filter out items which have a price below n dollars, select a bottle from the search results,
 * and add them to his cart. We have millions of users seeking wines with a price limit every second. The results need to be fast.
 *
 * On the backend, our algorithm runs a linear search through the entire list of wines comparing the price limit entered by
 * the customer with the price of every wine bottle in the list.
 *
 * Then, it returns items which have a price less than or equal to the price limit. This linear search has a time complexity of O(n).
 *
 * This means the bigger the number of wine bottles in our system, the more time it will take. The search time increases
 * proportionately to the number of new items introduced.
 *
 * If we start saving items in sorted order and search for items using the binary search, we can achieve a complexity of O(log n).
 *
 * With binary search, the time taken by the search results naturally increases with the size of the dataset, but not proportionately.
 *
 * Simply put, the algorithm compares the key value with the middle element of the array; if they are unequal,
 * the half in which the key cannot be part of is eliminated, and the search continues for the remaining half until it succeeds.
 *
 * Remember â€“ the key aspect here is that the array is already sorted.
 *
 * If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the key is not in the array.
